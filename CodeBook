# CodeBook for the tidy dataset

## Data source

This dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Feature selection

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. There were 2,947 rows(observations) in the test data set x_test.txt; and 7,352 rows (observations) in x_train.txt.

A “complete” data frame was made by:

1.  Reading measurement data from the test and training sub-directories, Merging in column names (measurement descriptors) using the file features.txt.
2.  Merging in activity names using the file activity_labels.txt.
3.  Merging in subject_ids from the files subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt.
4.  Combing the augmented test and training data into a single data frame with all of the observations and measurement columns, plus the ancillary merged fields.


Measurement columns containing the strings “std” or “mean” were identified; measurement columns not containing either of those strings were dropped.  The resulting data frame had 80 columns of measurement data, and one column each for subject and activity.name.


The script used the R function ColMeans to calculate the mean value for each kept feature, within subject and activity.name (180 rows for the 30 subjects and 6 activities).  The original measurement column names were retained, but slightly modified by removing the string “()” from each column name.


All of the data transformations and summarization are performed by a single R script, run_analysis.R.

In short, for this derived dataset, these signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
